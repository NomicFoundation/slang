# Rust Analyzer runs 'cargo check' frequently (on every file save) on the whole workspace. This locks
# '$REPO_ROOT/target' directory, and prevents building/running any other 'infra' commands until it is
# done. To avoid this during local development, let's use a separate target directory for this binary.
#
# Additionally, we cannot use 'cargo run --bin infra_cli' directly, because 'cargo run' sets a bunch
# of 'CARGO_*' environment variables, and they get propagated to any child `cargo` commands that are
# spawned by 'infra_cli'. We have to build and run the binary directly to ensure it has a clean env.
# Otherwise, they leak into cross-platform or multi-target builds, and cause build failures.
