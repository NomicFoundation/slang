# Helper script for running a command with a hermit context, mostly useful for Github workflows.
#
# This was created for running the sourcify tests. The sourcify tests don't require the whole `infra` 
# harness to compile/run. Setting that up is a bit of a waste. It gets way worse when running in 
# workflows because it can take well over 5 minutes to compile everything, even though all we _really_ 
# need from scripts/bin/infra is setting up the Hermit env.
