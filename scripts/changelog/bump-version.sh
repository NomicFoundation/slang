# This repository versions and releases all its artifacts together, generating the same changelog.
# Unfortunately, changesets does not support combining changelogs from multiple packages into one.
#
# So, our workaround is to use a single "changelog" package, and exclude everything else in "$REPO_ROOT/.changeset/config.json".
# We let changesets bump the version of this package, and generate its changelog.
# Then our build process copies the new version and the single changelog to other packages and crates.
#
# Additionally, changesets can only bump versions of packages in the root workspace.
# However, NAPI platform-specific packages cannot be added to the workspace, because other platforms will fail "npm install".
# So we have to bump the versions over ourselves anyways.
