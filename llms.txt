# Slang

> Slang is a modular set of compiler APIs empowering the next generation of Solidity code analysis and developer tooling. Written in Rust and distributed in multiple languages.

Slang analyzes Solidity source code to generate a rich, error-tolerant Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) that can be reasoned about. It provides a powerful API for querying and manipulating Solidity code, and navigating the binding graph of definitions and their references.

Slang supports over 80 versions of Solidity, and an error-tolerant frontend that works even when there are syntax/semantic errors, or missing dependencies. Its primary purpose is to serve as a foundation for tools like linters, IDEs, and static analyzers.
