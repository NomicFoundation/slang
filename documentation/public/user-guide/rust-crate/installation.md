# Installation

The Rust package is published to crates.io as [`slang_solidity`](https://crates.io/crates/slang_solidity) ([docs](https://docs.rs/slang_solidity/latest/slang_solidity/)).
It can be used both as a regular Rust dependency and as a standalone CLI (installable with Cargo).

You can install `slang` CLI as a cargo binary using:

```bash
cargo install "slang_solidity"
```

Or you can add its API as a dependency to your project:

```bash
cargo add "slang_solidity"
```
