If you are interested in using Slang in your project, we would love to hear from you! Please reach out to us on our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+pxApdT-Ssn5hMTFh), or via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/slang/issues/new).

Slang is already being used by a number of Solidity developer tools today, to name a few:

## Solidity VSCode

Nomic Foundation’s own Solidity VSCode extension, with over 300k downloads, is using it to provide advanced language features like Semantic Highlighting and Document Symbols. Other features are being migrated to Slang soon.
