If you are interested in using Slang in your project, we would love to hear from you! Please reach out to us on our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+pxApdT-Ssn5hMTFh), or via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/slang/issues/new).

Slang is already being used by a number of Solidity developer tools today, to name a few:

## Solidity VSCode

Nomic Foundationâ€™s own Solidity VSCode extension, with over 300k downloads, is using it to provide advanced language features like Semantic Highlighting and Document Symbols. Other features are being migrated to Slang soon.
