# User Guide

Welcome to the Slang user guide! This aims to be an introduction to Slang itself, its concepts and also contains a collection of guides how you can achieve basic tasks with it.

To get a good grasp on the concepts used in Slang, see the [Concepts](./concepts.md) section.

## Distributions

Slang itself is written in Rust and we maintain a public Rust package on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/slang_solidity). At the moment, we also distribute it as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomicfoundation/slang) with TypeScript interface. In the future, we plan on expanding the language bindings with Python and possibly more.

For the guides related to specific distributions, see below:

-   [Rust Crate](./rust-crate/index.md)
-   [NPM Package](./npm-package/index.md)
