description = "slang_testlang compiled as a cdylib crate, to be used as Node.js addon."

# At the time of writing, building cdylib/plugins with Cargo has limited support
# (see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8628> for the general tracking issue).
# To workaround some of the issues, we create a synthetic crate that shares the same code as the original Rust crate
# but only exposes a `cdylib` library.
# There are a couple of things at play here:
# - To build a Node addon, we need to build a standalone cdylib, that's set up to expect host `napi_*` functions at runtime
# - `napi build` does that for us but only supports `cdylib` for the `lib` targets (e.g. not bin/examples)
# - expansion of #[napi] macros is enabled behind a feature flag; it expands the code that expects the host functions
# - while `napi/noop` feature exists that disables that, we test in workspace with `--all-features` and Cargo features are additive
# - thus, they get conflated and so the regular `rlib` library target gets built with the host functions expectation
# - ...which reasonably fails to link when `rlib` library is used as a regular Rust library (i.e. not in Node environment).
# Another workaround is to use an example with `cdylib` crate-type (wouldn't conflate the features in a downstream usable
# library), but napi doesn't support that yet.
# Also see <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/771> for a similar issue with PyO3.
