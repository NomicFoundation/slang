# Unfortunately, we cannot just build the NAPI types using the original Rust crate, as this will prevent importing it
# into other crates that are not configured to be built via NAPI (produces various linker errors).
# So for now, we chose to use this separate crate to enable/expose the NAPI types, since nothing else needs to import it.
# Maybe we can spend more time in the future to debug/resolve the linker issues, but this solution is good enough for now.
