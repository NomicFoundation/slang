[build]
# The monorepo Cargo workspace builds to `$REPO_ROOT/target` by default.
# However, it uses different settings than the one NAPI sets during the build for this crate.
# Let's use a separate target-dir "$THIS_CRATE/target" to avoid invalidating the workspace-level cache.
target-dir = "./target"
