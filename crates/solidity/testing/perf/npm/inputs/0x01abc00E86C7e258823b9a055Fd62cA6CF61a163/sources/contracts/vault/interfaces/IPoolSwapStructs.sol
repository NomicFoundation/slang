interface IPoolSwapStructs {
    // This is not really an interface - it just defines common structs used by other interfaces: IGeneralPool and
    // IMinimalSwapInfoPool.
    //
    // This data structure represents a request for a token swap, where `kind` indicates the swap type ('given in' or
    // 'given out') which indicates whether or not the amount sent by the pool is known.
    //
    // The pool receives `tokenIn` and sends `tokenOut`. `amount` is the number of `tokenIn` tokens the pool will take
    // in, or the number of `tokenOut` tokens the Pool will send out, depending on the given swap `kind`.
    //
    // All other fields are not strictly necessary for most swaps, but are provided to support advanced scenarios in
    // some Pools.
    //
    // `poolId` is the ID of the Pool involved in the swap - this is useful for Pool contracts that implement more than
    // one Pool.
    //
    // The meaning of `lastChangeBlock` depends on the Pool specialization:
    //  - Two Token or Minimal Swap Info: the last block in which either `tokenIn` or `tokenOut` changed its total
    //    balance.
    //  - General: the last block in which *any* of the Pool's registered tokens changed its total balance.
    //
    // `from` is the origin address for the funds the Pool receives, and `to` is the destination address
    // where the Pool sends the outgoing tokens.
    //
    // `userData` is extra data provided by the caller - typically a signature from a trusted party.
