 * @dev Base authorization layer implementation for Pools.
 *
 * The owner account can call some of the permissioned functions - access control of the rest is delegated to the
 * Authorizer. Note that this owner is immutable: more sophisticated permission schemes, such as multiple ownership,
 * granular roles, etc., could be built on top of this by making the owner a smart contract.
 *
 * Access control of all other permissioned functions is delegated to an Authorizer. It is also possible to delegate
 * control of *all* permissioned functions to the Authorizer by setting the owner address to `_DELEGATE_OWNER`.
