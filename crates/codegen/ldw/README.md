# Language Design Workbench (LDW)

## Overview

The Language Design Workbench (LDW) is a tool for working with language
grammars and generating tooling and documentation for them. It allows you to
define grammars using a specific syntax and generates various TypeScript modules
to support language processing, parsing, formatting, and testing.

There is further documentation in the [docs/Overview.md](docs/Overview.md) file,
which describes the system in more detail, and in particular is used as an input
to AI prompts.

This project is largely generated by AI, and forms a testbed for using AI for
coding, especially in the field of programming language design and
implementation.

## Usage

### Using the LDW CLI

The Language Design Workbench CLI is built with TypeScript and runs directly
using ts-node, which allows for a smoother development experience and more
accurate error messages.

To use the Language Design Workbench CLI, run:

```
npm run ldw
```

For more information about available commands and options, run:

```
npm run ldw -- --help
```

Note: There's no need for a separate build step as the project uses ts-node to
run TypeScript files directly.
